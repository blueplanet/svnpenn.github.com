<p>I had this dream I lived on the 7th floor apartment. Somehow there were no
floors 1-6.</p>

<p>It was just a floor of apartments with stairs leading up to them, suspended by
magic. Someone left a letter at my door. When I get home, I accidentally kicked
the letter through the crack between the door and the walkway. I watched the
letter drift 100 feet to the ground.</p>

<p>Later I called Jeff over and guided him to the letter over a cell phone
conversation. As I watched him approach the letter from my post in the sky, a
strange feeling washed over me. The second his hand touched the letter I woke
up.</p>
