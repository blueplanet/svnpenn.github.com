<p>When I was a boy, there was an empty house just up the hill from my family&rsquo;s. It
was rumored a man committed suicide there after being possessed by the devil.
One day, a young woman, Lydia, moved into the house with her infant child. That
very night, Lydia was awakened by a loud, heinous hissing sound. She walked to
the nursery, and there, in baby&rsquo;s crib, was a snake wrapped around baby&rsquo;s neck,
squeezing tighter and tighter.</p>

<p>The crib was full of dirt. Baby struggled to free itself from underneath,
reaching and clawing, gasping for air. Embalmed bodies rose from their
sarcophagi, lurching toward baby, for they were mummies.</p>

<p>Amongst them was a man, tall, slim.</p>

<p>Almost instinctively, she turned to her husband. &ldquo;Oh, wait,&rdquo; she thought,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a husband.&rdquo; For Lydia and her husband had had an argument, one
they couldn&rsquo;t get past. Each night, they slept one inch farther apart, until one
night, Lydia left. It was about this time she lost herself in imaginary worlds.
She had quit the book club, the choir, citing something about their high
expectations. Her lips slowly grew together from disuse. Everytime she wanted to
act and didn&rsquo;t, another part of her face hardened, until it was stone. And that
fevered night, she rushed to the nursery, threw open the door,
&ldquo;Baby, are you okay?&rdquo; Baby sat up slowly, turned to mother and said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m fine, bitch, I&rsquo;m fine.&rdquo;</p>
