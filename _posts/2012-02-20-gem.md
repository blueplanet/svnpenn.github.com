RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a
standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a
self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the
installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. RubyGems is now part
of the standard library from Ruby version 1.9.

### Examples

{:lang='bash'}
	# Show the dependencies of an installed gem
	gem dependency jekyll
	# Install without docs
	gem install jekyll --no-ri --no-rdoc
	# Install certain version
	gem install redcarpet --version=1.17.2
	# Display all gems
	gem list
	# Uninstall
	gem uninstall jekyll
