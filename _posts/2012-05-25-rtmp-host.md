I never really liked RtmpExplorer. It only works with Internet Explorer, it is
closed source (sort of) and it requires the .NET Framework. rtmp-host.sh is
something I came up with. Basically it dumps the memory of Flash Player, which
contains all the RTMP parameters. It should find all the RTMP URLs, e.g. 
`rtmpte://cp97384.edgefcs.net`. Then you enter the host, e.g.
`cp97384.edgefcs.net`. After that it will automatically edit your hosts file,
invoke RtmpSrv, then RtmpDump. I have tested it on Cygwin but it should work on
MinGW with a little modification.
