On Linux the Home directory is typically `/home/Steven`, and is represented by
the variable `HOME`.

On Windows the Home directory is typically `C:\Users\Steven`, and is represented
by the variable `USERPROFILE`.

On both platforms, this folder has two purpose

* Hold user files, eg Music, Videos, Documents
* Hold user settings, eg `.gitconfig`, `.profile`, `.inputrc`

I take issue with this. I do not like putting config files directly into the
user folder. I prefer a separate folder for user files.
